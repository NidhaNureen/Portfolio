I'm a final year Computer Science student at the University of Auckland with a strong interest in building practical, user-focused software. I’m most confident in Python, and I also have experience with C#, JavaScript, and full-stack web development. 
I’m always looking to grow, take on new challenges, and contribute to teams that value collaboration and continuous learning. Outside of tech, I enjoy painting and reading as creative outlets, and I unwind with gaming — hobbies that keep me focused, curious, and creatively inspired in my work.
