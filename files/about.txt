I recently completed my Computer Science degree at the University of Auckland and build practical, user-focused software. I’m confident in Python, JavaScript, React.js, C#, and full-stack development with Flask and Node.js. I led the UI/UX redesign and worked as a full-stack developer on an Electron desktop app for wildlife researchers, optimizing performance to manage and analyze over 250,000 camera-trap images efficiently. Experienced with SQL databases, API integration, and Agile teamwork.

Outside of tech, I enjoy painting, reading, and gaming — hobbies that keep me curious, focused, and creatively inspired.
